in the meantime , the question faced by investors is : what is ual stock worth

the short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share
NP/N N/N N , ((S\NP)/(S\NP))/NP NP/N N/N N , (S[dcl]\NP)/S[em] S[em]/S[dcl] N/N N (S[dcl]\NP)/S[dcl] NP/N N (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[adj]\NP) (S[adj]\NP)/PP (PP/NP)/(PP/NP) (PP/NP)/(PP/NP) (PP/NP)/N[num] N[num] conj (PP/NP)/N[num] N[num] NP/N N
that 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times ual earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year
NP (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[pt]\NP) (S[pt]\NP)/PP PP/NP NP/N N (NP\NP)/NP ((N/N)/(N/N))/((N/N)/(N/N)) (N/N)/(N/N) N/N ((N/N)\(N/N))/(N/N) (N/N)/(N/N) N/N N/N N , (NP\NP)/(S[dcl]\NP) (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[pss]\NP) (S[pss]\NP)/(S[to]\NP) (S[to]\NP)/(S[b]\NP) (S[b]\NP)/NP (S\NP)\(S\NP) N/N N/N N/N[num] N[num] (NP\NP)/N N ((S\NP)\(S\NP))/N N
airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings
N/N N (S\NP)/(S\NP) (S[dcl]\NP)/PP PP/NP NP/N N (NP\NP)/NP N/N N (NP\NP)/NP NP/N N/N N (NP/N)\NP N/N N : (NP\NP)/(S[dcl]\NP) (S[dcl]\NP)/NP (S\NP)\(S\NP) (N/N)/(N/N) (N/N)/(N/N) N/N N
that 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy
NP (S[dcl]\NP)/S S/S[dcl] N/N N , ((S\NP)/(S\NP))/NP NP (NP\NP)/NP N/N N , (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[pt]\NP) (S[pt]\NP)/(S[adj]\NP) (S[adj]\NP)/PP PP/NP NP/N N/N N (NP\NP)/NP NP/N N
that analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings
NP/N N (S[dcl]\NP)/PP (S\NP)\(S\NP) PP/NP N/N N (NP/N)\NP N/S[em] S[em]/S[dcl] , (S/S)/NP NP/N N/N N (NP\NP)/NP NP/N N , N (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[pt]\NP) (S\NP)\(S\NP) (S[pt]\NP)/PP PP/NP NP/N N (NP\NP)/NP ((NP\NP)/S[dcl])\((NP\NP)/NP) NP (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[b]\NP) (S[b]\NP)/NP N (NP\NP)/NP N ((S\NP)\(S\NP))/((S\NP)\(S\NP)) ((S\NP)\(S\NP))/NP NP/N N (NP\NP)/NP N
so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event
