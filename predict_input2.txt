bond corp holdings ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million australian dollars -lrb- us$ 762.4 million -rrb- , the largest in australian corporate history
that loss compared with a year-earlier profit of a$ 273.5 million
in preliminary , unaudited results reported friday , bond corp. also posted an operating loss of a$ 814.1 million for the year ended june 30 , compared with operating profit of a$ 354.7 million a year earlier
operating revenue rose 69 % to a$ 8.48 billion from a$ 5.01 billion
but the net interest bill jumped 85 % to a$ 686.7 million from a$ 371.1 million
bond corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property
much of bond corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of bond corp. 's assets and those of its units
the results included a a$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of a$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in lonrho plc
however , bond corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later
earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to a$ 123.8 million from a$ 247.3 million
the company said the general financial performance of its u.s. brewing operations , g. heileman brewing co. , was disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results
bond corp. 's shares closed friday before news of the results at 28 australian cents a share , up one australian cent
the staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for alan bond and his flagship , bond corp
only a year ago , the chairman of bond corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies
now bond corp. has agreed to sell at least half its australian brewing assets
it has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block
but in a tv interview sunday mr. bond said , we 've taken a big loss
we 've taken it on the chin
but we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business
bond corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses
it said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios
the result will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , bond corp. directors said in a statement
some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and bond corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is uncertainty regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm
bond corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of a$ 1.92 a share a year ago
still , the directors said , having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent
indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the true worth of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into a substantial positive one
for cathay pacific airways , the smooth ride may be ending
the first signs of trouble came last month when the hong kong carrier , a subsidiary of swire pacific ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year
securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead
fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through hong kong remains clouded by china 's turmoil since the june 4 killings in beijing
in addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes
and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline
there also is concern that once hong kong reverts to china 's sovereignty in 1997 , cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to china 's often-disparaged flag carrier , civil aviation administration of china , or caac
the sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , says rod eddington , cathay 's commercial director
sarah hall , an analyst at james capel -lrb- far east -rrb- ltd. , says there is n't much cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , hong kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the u.s. dollar
these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , ms. hall says
ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next
in 1988 , it earned $ 2.82 billion hong kong -lrb- us$ 361.5 million -rrb- on revenue of hk$ 11.79 billion
cathay is taking several steps to bolster business
one step is to beef up its fleet
in addition to aircraft from boeing co. , cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 airbus a330-300s
the expansion , which could cost as much as us$ 5.7 billion over the next eight years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last year , according to sun hung kai securities ltd
the fuel-efficient airbus planes will be used largely to replace cathay 's aging fleet of lockheed tristars for regional flights , while the boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to europe and north america
cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside hong kong
fierce bidding for young employees in hong kong is pushing up cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain
some jobs already have been moved to australia , and there are plans to place others in canada
david bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997
cathay is working to promote hong kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover
although the june 4 killings in beijing have hurt its china flights , cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors
mr. eddington regards promoting hong kong as an important part of attracting visitors from japan , south korea and taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged
there also has been speculation that cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal
cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation
mr. eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly cathay 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines -- as an important part of cathay 's strategy
but he emphasizes that cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa , the west german airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade
analysts believe cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among european carriers
we think alliances are very important , mr. eddington says
but we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's
i 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother
in a pattern it aims to copy in several key u.s. destinations , cathay recently announced plans to serve san francisco by flying into american airlines ' los angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier
we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific , mr. eddington says
but this way , american will coordinate good extensions to boston , new york , chicago and dallas
we 'll coordinate on this end to places like bangkok , singapore and manila
asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay
cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into vietnam
further expansion into southern europe is also possible , says mr. bell , the spokesman
while a large number of hong kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an option for cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in hong kong
and mr. eddington emphatically rules out a move to london : our lifeblood is hong kong traffic rights
he says the airline is putting its faith in the sino-british agreement on hong kong 's return to china
a special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong kong 's airlines , which include the smaller hong kong dragon airlines , will continue to be negotiated by hong kong 's government
but critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing
my feeling is -lcb- cathay does n't -rcb- have a hope in the long run , says an analyst , who declines to be identified
cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something
mr. eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the sino-british agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future
we 're confident that it protects our route structure , he says , and our ability to grow and prosper
sotheby 's inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off
the new york arm of the london-based auction house auctioned off the estate of john t. dorrance jr. , the campbell 's soup co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection
that total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement sotheby 's had made with the dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house
sotheby 's provided the dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold
the dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings
an henri matisse , auctioned last wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist
in addition , a handful of paintings from the dorrance collection remain to be sold at sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in january
first , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s
then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s
what now
to judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety
where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing
lisa zeidner 's third novel , limited partnerships -lrb- north point press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -rrb- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it
nora worth and malcolm dewitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional philadelphia neighborhood
malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer
nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera
after all , she reasons , there were housewives with nikons and degrees from cooking schools in france who would kill for her job
but nora and malcolm feel trapped
they seem to be having the worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit
it 's a downbeat , thirtysomething world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do
uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives
malcolm faces bankruptcy and an irs audit , but nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold
while she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , david , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom
the irony in this novel is that neither man represents a safe middle-class haven : nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere
the characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a middle way between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty
in making malcolm and nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , ms. zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters
the humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -lrb- even the characters ' own -rrb- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters
but readers may well feel the pangs of recognition
in any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction
rascal money -lrb- contemporary books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -rrb- , a novel by consultant and business analyst joseph r. garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called pegasys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by aiw , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world
patrician , dynamic scott thatcher , founder and head of pegasys , initially finds the takeover threat risible
but , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind aiw is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal
mr. garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel
and like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out
mr. garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures
standard-issue portraits of flaky californians , snobbish homosexuals and neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions
yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : if the head of aiw were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process

in terms of sheer brutality , the somali regime of siad barre may rank as no. 1 in the world
the only reason that somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of texas
the barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill
beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years
up to 500,000 somalis have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops
in the port of berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival issak clan were rounded up in may 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever
guns were never used : each man was stabbed to death with a large knife
the horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees
the study was done by robert gersony , a consultant to the u.s. state department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide
what gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the horn of africa
not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks
mr. barre 's rule is crumbling fast
mutinies wrack his armed forces -lrb- really just an armed gang -rrb- , which control less than half the country
inflation is at record levels
desperate , he has called in the libyans to help fight the rebels of the somali national movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of mogadishu
seventy years old and a self-declared scientific socialist , president barre has a power base , composed only of his minority mareham clan , that according to observers is narrowing
the u.s. 's interest in somalia consists of a single runway at the port of berbera , which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the gulf of aden and the indian ocean
that strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of american nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of sports illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world
in the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to mr. barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control
as long as the rival soviet-backed regime of mengistu haile mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring ethiopia , the u.s. was forced to accept that lonely berbera runway as a distant no. 2 to the soviets ' array of airfields next door
but due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the american runway
on sept. 7 , i wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 ethiopian soldiers by eritrean and tigrean guerrillas
recently , in wollo province in the center of ethiopia , tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops
-lrb- think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance -rrb-
tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of addis ababa , threatening the town of dese , which would cut off mr. mengistu 's capital from the port of assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach addis ababa
as a result , mr. mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in eritrea only to keep the tigreans at bay
mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : half his army is tied down defending the northern city of asmara from the eritreans
the weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the u.s. for help
while the tigreans are communists , like the eritreans they are among the most anti-soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the soviet-supplied mengistu air force
what this all means in shorthand is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is collapsing as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is
the u.s. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the horn of africa
back to somalia :
the state department , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from mr. barre , evinced by its decision to publish the gersony report -lrb- which the press has ignored -rrb-
what 's more , the u.s. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid
but this is not enough
because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre , when he goes the runway could go too
considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential somalis to understand
it is a certainty that mr. barre 's days are numbered
the u.s. should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him
nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be
but as one expert tells me : whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre
while the state department positions itself for the post-barre period in somalia , it should continue to back former president carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between mr. mengistu and the eritrean guerrillas in ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the tigrean rebels through neighboring sudan
ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and byzantine in all of black africa
remember that it took mr. mengistu many months , in what became known as the creeping coup , to topple emperor haile selassie in 1974 and 1975
there is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent
but the u.s. has one great advantage : the soviets are universally loathed throughout ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all
it 's not just in eastern europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side , but on the horn of africa as well
the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre , and that should be cut fast
mr. kaplan , author of surrender or starve : the wars behind the famine -lrb- westview press , 1988 -rrb- , lives in lisbon
diversification pays
that 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's friday-the-13th plunge
stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last thursday , according to figures compiled by lipper analytical services inc
that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday , last monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed
but several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide
funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds
more than ever , people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio , said jeremy duffield , a senior vice president of vanguard group
that means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate
one week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision
but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough
you want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , said kurt brouwer , an investment adviser with brouwer & janachowski in san francisco
it 's like kicking the tires of a car ...
what you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform
general equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the standard & poor 's 500-stock index
but lipper analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations
gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 %
flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27 % , according to lipper
global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolios outside the u.s.
this gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like the past week , when the dollar declines against other major currencies
with all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07 % in the week through last thursday
but while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : a diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot
and friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment
thus , even including the latest week , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % so far this year , the lipper analytical figures show
by comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 %
fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average
that 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , said mr. brouwer
you do n't make any real money
over the last 20 years , for example , mr. brouwer says , an investor putting $ 5,000 a year in the s&p 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in treasury bills
some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on friday the 13th
the $ 4 million monetta fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return
its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 %
the fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30 % over its cost
by the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , monetta was 55 % in cash , said robert bacarella , president and portfolio manager
last monday , he started buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices
among mr. bacarella 's picks : oracle systems , reebok international ltd. and digital microwave corp
the fund 's cash position is now about 22 % , which mr. bacarella calls still bearish
among the big stock funds , dreyfus fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year
in a downward market , bonds act better , he said
we still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market
we believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world
many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak
from its high point on thursday , oct. 12 , to where it traded late in new york a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the west german mark , 3.4 % against the british pound and 2.1 % against the japanese yen
three international cash portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week
because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines
all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date
of the funds that fared the worst in the post-oct 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the ual corp buy-out plan
reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the fidelity select air transportation portfolio and the national aviation & technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the fidelity air transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for national aviation & technology
the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign , said a. michael lipper , president of lipper analytical
noting that equity funds are up nearly 60 % from their post-crash low on dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment
there 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness
but investors do n't seem to think so
several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th
vanguard group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week
there certainly has n't been a panic reaction , said steven norwitz , a vice president at t. rowe price associates
people showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities

groupe ag 's chairman said the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider
amid heavy buying of shares in belgium 's largest insurer , maurice lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock
since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving ag a market value of about 105 billion belgian francs -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb-
the most likely white knight would be societe generale de belgique s.a. , which already owns 18 % of ag and which itself is controlled by cie financiere de suez , the acquisitive french financial conglomerate
but mr. lippens said a rescue also could involve asahi mutual life insurance co. , which owns 5 % of ag
ag is hardly alone in its anxiety
a rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping europe 's once-stately insurance business
worried by european community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars
in west germany and the netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks
in france , suez and axa-midi assurances s.a. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; suez last month acquired control of groupe victoire , the sixth-largest european insurance company , after a takeover battle with cie industrielle
mr. lippens said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-september
but he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months
aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions , mr. lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them , axa-midi , union des assurances de paris and suez , all based in france
they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag , he said
any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's battlements
a syndicate of shareholders holds just under 50 % of ag , mr. lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares
aside from generale de belgique and asahi , the syndicate includes antwerpsche hypotheekkas , a belgian savings bank , and various family interests
a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control
asahi officials could n't be reached for comment
even without bid talk , this year 's surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag
the company says those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in belgium
how interestingly clever of robert goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of days of rage in his television critique -lrb- leisure & arts , sept 11 -rrb-
he chastises jo franklin-trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as intellectually slipshod
was not the title very clear
one example he gives : she did n't ask -lrb- why the palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones -rrb-
really now , did she have to ask
were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough
mr. goldberg contends that even as propaganda the film fails because it presents only one view
of course the palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the israelis feel put upon
but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from israelis about how badly the palestinians are behaving is irrelevant
it 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white south africans are
this film did emphasize how long the israeli\/palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of world war i when the british tried to guarantee both a jewish state and a palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done
well , days of rage airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning
every issue is multisided
this film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media
now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only

it said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 6.8 million , or 19 cents a share , in the year-ago period
its revenue totaled $ 184.4 million , an increase of 172 % from $ 67.8 million a year ago
for the nine months , the san jose , calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share
revenue nearly tripled to $ 479 million , from $ 160 million
analysts expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business
that 's a faster growth rate than reported by compaq , which did n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986
but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up
conner 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment
since its inception , conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines
today , conner controls an estimated 90 % of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers
the company supplies drives to compaq and zenith data systems , the top two u.s. manufacturers of laptops , and to toshiba corp. , nec corp. and sharp corp. , the leading japanese laptop makers
they 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , said bob katsive , an analyst at disk\/trend inc. , a market researcher in los altos , calif
in the coming months , however , this is likely to change
next month , seagate technology , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers
and the japanese are likely to keep close on conner 's heels
they are going to catch up , said david claridge , an analyst with hambrecht & quist
both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk drives , and sony also is studying the field , mr. claridge said
but conner is n't standing still
yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks
each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces
most of our competitors are announcing products based on our -lrb- older -rrb- products , said finis conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name
we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can
these new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company 's business in 1990 , mr. conner estimated
we 're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , he said
conner already is shipping its new drives
last week , for instance , compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews
conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase
from its inception , conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as seagate
the availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage
conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to compaq , which as of july owned 40 % of conner 's stock
sales to compaq represented 26 % of conner 's business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year-ago period
after several years of booming business with china , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade
the imposition of austerity measures , starting last october , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in tiananmen square on june 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter
foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects
and beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash
givaudan far east ltd. , a swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in china , typifies the problems
last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of chinese factories
the company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half
the june killings magnified the problems
in canton , givaudan 's representative office received no orders in june
at first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in august and september , manager donald lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months
things have grown worse since june 4 , mr. lai says
he predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million
the consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of china 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest
but in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch
the import pie will shrink , says john kamm , first vice president of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong and a china trade specialist
on the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat
china 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade
the last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange
the current trough is expected to be much deeper , because beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation
in addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june killings have been a big setback
the freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , says raymond wong , china manager for mannesmann ag , a west german machinery-trading company
in the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier
the picture for china 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze
exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to chinese customs figures
the threat to china 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings
the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in june from $ 19 billion in april
the trend has prompted beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports
in recent weeks , china 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities
the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses
beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping china export
for example , nissho iwai corp. , one of the biggest japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from china as it sells to that country
three years ago , the ratio was reversed
but the strategy is n't helping much this time
both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , says masahiko kitamura , general manager of nissho iwai 's canton office
he expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year
for a short time after june 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright
many foreign trading offices in hong kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties
even the bank of china , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health
but when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen
the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers
business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say
shanghai investment & trust co. , known as sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business
sitco had customarily tapped the japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer
foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash
it has difficulties paying its foreign debts , says a hong kong executive who is familiar with sitco 's business
how can it make available funds for purchases
foreign traders also say many of china 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit
albert lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months
there are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , he says
even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years
and foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because china is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years
another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics
these have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly
but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices
to stem speculation , beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year
traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock
the resulting stockpiling has depressed the market
but beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business
mr. kamm , the china trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials

the collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has handed wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal
their $ 700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ 400 million in paper losses the takeover traders , known as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when gulf oil co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for cities service co
in the six trading days since the ual labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing , culminating friday with the withdrawal of its partner british airways plc , ual stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 1\/2 from 285 1\/4
the arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the ual deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when occidental petroleum co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of cities service
in the meantime , the question faced by investors is : what is ual stock worth
the short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share
that 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times ual earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year
airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings
that 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy
that analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings
so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event
one analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $ 225 area , but that it could take three to four months to close
at that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes ual stock should trade closer to
other observers note that ual 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal
by that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher
investment bankers following ual agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success
the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds
on friday , they also persuaded the ual flight attendants to join them
however , investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ 5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17 % in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of northwest airlines parent nwa corp. in july
banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal
that way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader
that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone
one obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership
investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control
one way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders
the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking
but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders
the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied
in advising the ual board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from mr. davis , the investment bank of first boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions
first boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection
using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , first boston estimated ual 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to wall street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at nwa ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike
and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets , first boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share
unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month
american airlines parent amr and usair group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results
some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots
the deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , so many moving parts
i do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving
in addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt
in the meantime , the arbs are bleeding
wall street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own ual stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding
frank gallagher , an analyst with phoenix capital corp. in new york , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a share for their ual positions
that would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on ual alone totalling $ 725 million

opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets
output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out
but industry and opec officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if opec does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters
as a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency
the organization is scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. 25
so far this year , rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others
but that could change if demand for opec 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen
opec is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to opec and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the oil daily and the international herald tribune
at that rate , a majority of opec 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said
but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within opec
most is concentrated in five persian gulf countries , including his own , issam al-chalabi , iraq 's oil minister , told the conference friday
he puts opec 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day
that 's higher than some other estimates
ali khalifa al-sabah , kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated opec capacity at 25 million barrels a day
either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge
even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as saudi arabia and iraq , could upset the market
the iraqi oil minister and saudi oil minister hisham nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market
however , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member
under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system
if you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity asked mr. al-chalabi
at an inconclusive geneva meeting late last month , opec 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling
they doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments
the main effect of the ceiling boost was to legitimize some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters
still , there was a breakthrough at geneva
previously , no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling
but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers
in the end politics got in the way
libya accepted iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with kuwait
and the united arab emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways
but the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting
it 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan
the ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others
libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the united arab emirates is still an issue
saudi arabia , opec 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some opec sources said
insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members
in geneva , however , they supported iran 's proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the opec total intact , and increased actual saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million
some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on saudi arabia to give back to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels
though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share
mr. nazer , the saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any quota revisions
under any circumstances , saudi arabia should get more rather than less , mr. nazer said
in a blow to france 's rafale jet fighter , the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 mcdonnell douglas corp. f-18 hornets to defend its aircraft carriers
the statement is likely to sharpen the debate within france 's military establishment over the rafale , which is made by avions marcel dassault-breguet aviation sa
in an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine cols bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , adm. yves goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century
the air force is to take at least 250 more
adm. goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of american-made crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack
rather than renovate the crusaders , which dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion french francs -lrb- $ 286.6 million -rrb- , adm. goupil said the navy wants to buy used f-18s from the u.s. navy
officially , the statement is n't an attack on the rafale
adm. goupil said that when the f-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take rafales to replace them
but unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use
although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the f-18 on operational grounds
adm. goupil 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of dassault
although government-controlled , dassault still is run by the founder 's son , chairman serge dassault , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence
the rafale project is the result of france 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs
so far , mr. dassault has resisted pressure to change
what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them
adm. goupil , a former crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use crusaders , the philippines , retired its last ones two years ago
a french crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here
adm. goupil rejected dassault 's proposal to renovate the crusaders , saying the cost was impossible to estimate
even modernized , he said , the crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers france has sent to meet such crises as the wars in lebanon and the persian gulf
defense minister jean-pierre chevenement told a meeting of the anglo-american press association that the question of modernizing the crusaders or buying used f18s is a political decision that he will make in due time
eastern enterprises , bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit , had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share
last year , eastern had a quarter loss of $ 1.7 million , or eight cents a share
quarter revenue rose 44 % to $ 160.1 million from $ 111.2 million a year ago
the weston , mass. , utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter , usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business , were also aided by higher gas sales and the may 1989 acquisition of water products company
for the nine months , eastern had net income of $ 41.8 million , or $ 1.80 a share , up 23 % from $ 33.9 million or $ 1.46 a share a year ago
revenue grew 24 % to $ 614.5 million from $ 497.1 million
ekco group inc. , nashua , n.h. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier
robert stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's masillon , ohio , bakeware facility
softer-than-expected orders in early september also played a role , he said in an interview
but mr. stein said he is reasonably confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988
that would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that mr. stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate
in the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share
third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ 40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year earlier , according to neil gordon , treasurer
the year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's woodstream corp. unit , acquired last january , but include some canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988
august through october traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items
mr. stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in september but have been ordering more heavily in october
mr. stein said woodstream is marginally profitable but has n't performed as well as expected
woodstream 's victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are doing very well , and its plastic storage-case products are poised for growth , he said
but the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a depressed market , and ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said
mr. stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of ekco housewares in late 1987
-lrb- prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as centronics corp. ; centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but mr. stein and other officers decided to sell that business after japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market -rrb-
mr. stein said tighter operating controls have enabled ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit
by moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said
in addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that mr. stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands
ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the u.s. and canada
the main issue in the strike at the ohio facility was health-care benefits , mr. stein said
the strike ended oct
ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , mr. stein said
he indicated that ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers
a shareholder filed suit , seeking to block unitel video inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held kenmare capital corp. for $ 15 a share , or $ 33.6 million
the suit , which seeks class-action status , was filed in delaware chancery court
the complaint alleges that the price is unfair and grossly inadequate and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a lockup of the purchase of unitel , thereby discouraging other bids
it seeks unspecified money damages
the new york company called the lawsuit without merit
shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction nov

president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week
mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to inflict
if the request is approved by both the house and senate , mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money , according to senate budget analysts
that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has
it 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , said chairman james sasser -lrb- d. , tenn -rrb- of the senate budget committee , who said he would oppose the request
that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose , he said
the president 's request did n't indicate how mr. cheney would shift the money
a pentagon official said the request was made to give the department maximum flexibility to deal with the cuts
last week , budget director richard darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget
that would give agencies less ability ... to fudge over things , he told reporters
under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled
lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law
with the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in panama , one of the many lingering questions the bush administration will ponder is this : is the national security council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy
president bush 's national security adviser , lt. gen. brent scowcroft , came into office in january intent on making the nsc staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the reagan administration
gen. scowcroft was a member of the tower commission , which investigated the iran-contra affair
he was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked president reagan 's second term
so , following both the style he pursued as president ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the tower commission , gen. scowcroft has pruned the nsc staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the state department , pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out
the tower commission specifically said that the nsc staff should be small and warned against letting energetic self-starters like lt. col. oliver north strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the state department , pentagon or central intelligence agency
however , the panama episode has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues
during the coup attempt and its aftermath , nsc staffers were stretched very thin , says one senior administration official
it 's a very small shop
gen. scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds
the nsc staff does n't have the horsepower that i believe is required to have an effective interagency process , says frank gaffney , a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy , a conservative washington think-tank
the problem with this administration , i think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the nsc
the national security council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the white house to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the state department , pentagon and intelligence agencies
by law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense
in practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as unofficial members
but the size , shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide
that task is one of washington 's perennial problems
in the bush white house , the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say
administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis
but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc staffer most experienced in latin america , everett briggs , was gone
he had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with assistant secretary of state bernard aronson over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels
the absence of mr. briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current nsc staff
both gen. scowcroft and his deputy , robert gates , are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs
gen. scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and mr. gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society
both have become confidants of president bush
but neither has an extensive background in latin america , the middle east or asia
in those areas , the role of nsc staffers under them therefore have become more important
gen. scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state department and pentagon bureaus
but just as every previous nsc adviser has , gen. scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the nsc staff becomes too lean and too restrained
former u.n. ambassador jeane kirkpatrick , in a cnn capital gang discussion oct. 7 of house action on federal catastrophic-illness insurance :
i think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action , as a matter of fact ...
they will have to revisit this issue , and they 'll have to revisit it before long
translant inc. , rancho cucamonga , calif. , got an $ 86 million navy contract for missile-launch systems
general electric co. received a $ 30.6 million air force contract for mx-missile nose cones
goodyear tire & rubber co. was awarded a $ 19.1 million army contract for armored-vehicle parts
analytic sciences corp. was awarded a $ 10.1 million air force contract for technical support
moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of pinnacle debt because of accelerating deficiency in liquidity , which it said was evidenced by pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments
henry sargent jr. , pinnacle executive vice president , said the action wo n't really have any effect on us
we are n't selling bonds right now , and i do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds
the rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated eurodebentures to b-3 from b-1
merabank 's rating for short-term deposits remains not prime
securities of merabank were placed under review last may , and will remain under review for downgrade , the agency said
bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again
as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative
and that , they say , will be good for bonds
recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , said elliott platt , director of economic research at donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities
mr. platt is advising clients that the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward
analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the federal reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks
that would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the fed would ease
investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall
but when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled
long-term bonds have performed erratically this year
for example , a group of long-term treasury bonds tracked by merrill lynch & co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and -0.06 % in the third quarter
total return is price changes plus interest income
now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins
among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed
at the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating
add it all up and it means that the fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , said norman robertson , chief economist at mellon bank corp. , pittsburgh
i think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1\/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end
the federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the fed 's credit policy
economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the fed from around 9 % , where it had been since july , to about 8 3\/4 % in early october on the heels of a weak employment report
although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred oct. 13 , it ended friday at about 8 11\/16 %
james kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at merrill lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall
given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , he said
mr. kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term treasurys
he says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities
if the -lcb- tennessee valley authority -rcb- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , he said
tva , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week
strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion
tva , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government
but persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the u.s. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities
today , the treasury department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction
tomorrow , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes
resolution funding corp. , known as refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds
all of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in november
so far , investors have n't shown much appetite for refcorp 's initial bond offering
roger early , a portfolio manager at federated investors corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention
why should i bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield he said
i 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out
he seems to be typical of many professional money managers
when the size of the refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage point more than the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond
on friday , the yield was quoted at about 1\/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand
some economists believe that yields on all treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply
but once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data
the supply is not a constraint to the market , said samuel kahan , chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc
if one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming
friday 's market activity
most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline
junk bond prices moved higher , however
in early trading , treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese investors would continue
also providing support to treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks
those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance
treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1\/4 point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount
the benchmark 30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 1\/4 during the day , ended at 101 17\/32
the yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 %
in the corporate bond market , traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following chicago & north western acquisition corp. 's $ 475 million junk bond offering friday
today , for example , underwriters at morgan stanley & co. said they expect to price a $ 150 million , 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by imo industries inc
traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 %
shearson lehman hutton inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by r.p. scherer drugs is expected by the end of the month
however , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done
there are about a dozen more deals coming , said michael mcnamara , director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services inc
if they had this much trouble with chicago & north western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest
last week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market
and pressure by big investors forced donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. to sweeten chicago & north western 's $ 475 million junk bond offering
after hours of negotiating that stretched late into thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that had been expected
the coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101
however , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 %
debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in chicago & north western 's parent company
the coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , said a spokesman for donaldson
we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done
the spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from japanese investors
in the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed 1\/2 point higher , while investment-grade corporate bonds fell 1\/8 to 1\/4 point
falcon cable systems co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed
falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions
a spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end
this city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake
estimates of damage in the six-county san francisco bay area neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system
the bay bridge , the main artery into san francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks
part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the richter scale
the bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day
also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have been closed for repairs
the bay area rapid transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000
bart has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught
most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the east bay towns of oakland and berkeley
for the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the east bay and san francisco
the red and white fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from marin county , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering east bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip
that tariff is too stiff for some financial district wage earners
i 'll stay with bart , said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube
officials expect the golden gate bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including east bay residents making a long detour
we 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , said one official
about 23,000 people typically travel over the golden gate bridge during commute hours
about 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period
meetings canceled by apple computer inc. 's european sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants
it also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters
other cities are calling -lcb- groups booked here for tours and conferences -rcb- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , said scott shafer , a spokesman for mayor art agnos
city officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city
the other five bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion
all estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion
among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in san francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage
the most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the embarcadero freeway
until it was closed tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the bay bridge heading into the financial district
engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the embarcadero structure
as part of the quake recovery effort , the city building department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the financial district 's high-rises
the preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that we were incredibly lucky , said lawrence kornfield , san francisco 's chief building inspector
while many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage
city building codes require construction that can resist temblors
in england , martin leach , a spokesman for lloyd 's of london , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster
the extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , mr. leach said
on friday , during a visit to california to survey quake damage , president bush promised to meet the federal government 's obligation to assist relief efforts
california officials plan to ask congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans
the state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year
some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief
however , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum

bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation , after all
matthew lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $ 5,000 for the best verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you
he sent out thousands of news releases from his kensington , md. , office
he plugged the contest on larry king 's radio show , on pat sajak 's television show and on the c-span cable television network
he talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit
mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now
after all , he says , we 've got like 15 million bureaucrats
and in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500
so far , though , mr. lesko has received only one entry
to make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who nominated her boss
mr. lesko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats
but he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file folks
he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest
newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases
talk show hosts quickly change the topic
but mr. lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest
is the government not helping anybody asks toni murray , an assistant to mr. lesko
mr. lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation
people hate to write , he says
maybe people do n't believe i want to give this money away
maybe americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while
if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , mr. lesko admits , i 'd get 5,000 entries
now there 's an idea
sitting at the bar of the four seasons restaurant , architect william mcdonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting
he is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts
look how much air is moving around he says
the ventilation here is great
you may be hearing more about the 38-year-old mr. mcdonough and his preoccupation with clean air
after years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture
mr. mcdonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests
he has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star quilted giraffe restaurant -- architecturally impeccable , progressive architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of paul stuart , the madison avenue clothing store
he has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space
what really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture
now the question is : is poland ready for it
mr. mcdonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed warsaw trade center in poland , the first such center in eastern europe
the project has already acquired a certain new york cachet
bloomingdale 's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays
some of the sales proceeds will go to the design industries foundation for
aids
a cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an
aids
benefit at sotheby 's in december
if mr. mcdonough 's plans get executed , as much of the polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from warsaw 's abundant rubble
a 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space
solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow
the windows will open
the carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes
to the extent that the $ 150 million budget will allow it , mr. mcdonough will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde
if mr. mcdonough has his way , the poles will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear
the poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ 150,000 , with the center 's developer footing the bill
the news has n't exactly moved others in mr. mcdonough 's profession to become architectural johnny appleseeds
all architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says john burgee , whose new york firm is designing the redevelopment of times square , but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme
karen nichols , senior associate at michael graves 's architecture firm in princeton , n.j. , says : we 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily
mr. mcdonough responds : i 'm asking people to broaden their agendas
the son of a seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , mr. mcdonough was born in tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from hong kong to shaker heights , ohio , before entering dartmouth college
he earned a master 's degree in architecture from yale
his interest in the natural environment dates from his youth
he and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in iceland
living in hong kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies
at his first school in the u.s. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers
he and a dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in vermont
at yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in ireland
mr. mcdonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the environmental defense fund in new york
the offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows
since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution
to reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office
jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic
the budget was only $ 400,000
athens with spartan means , mr. mcdonough says
the fund 's lawyers work in an athenian grove of potted trees
economists and administrators sit along a boulevard with street lamps and ficus trees
in offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight
offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight
we proved a healthy office does n't cost more , says frederic krupp , executive director of the fund
it really looks beautiful and is very light , says ann hornaday , a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings
but , she says , i guess i did n't really notice the trees
maybe they were hidden by all the people
neither the quilted giraffe nor the paul stuart renovation reflects much of mr. mcdonough 's environmental concern
the restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline geode
it makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors
to more than replace the wood from two english oaks used for paneling at paul stuart , however , mr. mcdonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country
the ambitious warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials
its developer is a polish american , sasha muniak
he had worked with mr. mcdonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center
the center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in poland now , for a growing number of westerners doing business in eastern europe
mr. mcdonough thinks of the center as the eiffel tower of warsaw and a symbol of the resurgence of poland
if any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is poland
jessica mathews , vice president of world resources institute in washington , d.c. , says that perhaps a quarter of poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution
the pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the middle ages
the future of the forest remains uncertain
mr. muniak 's company , balag ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained
after all , mr. muniak says , in poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment
they 're more worried about bread on the table

rochester telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of urban telephone , but a price was n't disclosed

immunex corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma
the molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor
il-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response
the il-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense
but in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction
a soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said
the il-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by receptech corp. , a spinoff of immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering
immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents
immunex will have the option to buy back receptech shares after five years

growth is good
at least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers
they are starting to buy growth stocks
remember them
the upper echelon of this group were shares of the nifty 50 companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin
that sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years
the current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones
those are unwelcome trends in a year that the dow jones industrial average has risen 23 % so far , even with the 190.58-point plunge on oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood
the question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains
that 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks
i think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , says steven einhorn , partner at goldman sachs
growth stocks may be as big as philip morris or medium-sized such as circuit city stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say
the period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , says stephen boesel , president of t. rowe price 's growth and income fund
growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading
this kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds john calverley , senior economist for american express bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the nifty 50
and they will again , say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme
cabanne smith , president of a money management company bearing his name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings momentum will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further
he also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices
we 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , mr. smith says
mr. smith recommends cypress semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate
ronald sloan , executive vice president of siebel capital management , likes wellman inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting
mr. sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years
wellman stock closed friday at 39 3\/8 , up 1\/8 ; mr. sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60
others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks
carmine grigoli , chief market strategist for first boston , who still says , we expect the dow average -lcb- to be at -rcb- 3000 by mid-1990 , nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime
he recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as philip morris , pepsico , cpc international , reebok international , and limited inc
all have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year
some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle
one of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , says mr. boesel of t. rowe price
james wright , chief investment officer for banc one asset management , says , we 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks
he recently trimmed his portfolio of international paper , dow chemical , quantum chemical , international business machines and digital equipment

big cyclical companies are using all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , says mr. sloan
he cites ibm , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares
what they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns internally , says mr. sloan
when they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below returns on the stock
ibm says it considers its shares a good investment
but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals
growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy
goldman sachs 's mr. einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario
he suggests investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead , as well as growth issues
friday 's market activity
stock prices finished about unchanged friday in quiet expiration trading
traders anticipated a volatile session due to the october expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks
but there were fewer price swings than expected
buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the new york stock exchange
but block trading desks and money managers made a concerted effort to meet the imbalances with stock to sell , one trader said

most of last week 's surge in the industrial average came on monday , when the average rose 88.12 points as market players snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market
that contrast was reflected in the smaller weekly percentage gains recorded by the broader averages
the s&p 500 rose 4 % , the dow jones equity market index gained 3.7 % and the new york stock exchange composite index added 3.5 %

investors bailed out of new york city bonds in droves last week , driving prices lower and boosting yields
one bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone
while that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , friday 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors
i 've never seen so many -lcb- new york city -rcb- g.o. 's up for sale , said another trader
every broker has blocks of every size and maturity
municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty
a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the november mayoral election
-lrb- general obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit -rrb-
although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold
the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected
new york , one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds , sold $ 750 million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago
there have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the october 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt
the recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns
meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding
rumors persisted last week that new york 's credit ratings -- single-a from moody 's investors service inc. and single-a-minus from standard & poor 's corp. -- are at risk
the weakness in new york city bonds follows a warning from new york state comptroller edward regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city 's economy
in a study , the comptroller said , the city 's glory days are over
mr. regan warned mayoral candidates to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the new york city economy
new york city 's revised financial plan , due out later this month , is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ 27 billion budget
at present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit
mark page , new york 's deputy director of finance , said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves
he charges the city 's critics with spreading unfounded emotional rhetoric
there are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis
the leading contender for the mayoral office , democrat david dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs
and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election
until last week , mr. dinkins was considered a shoo-in
the market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , said bernard b. beal , chief executive of m.r. beal & co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market
until last week , everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election
now , there have been a number of questions raised
last week , yields on long-term new york city general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point
new york city 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % thursday
as the yield on new york general obligation bonds rose , the bond buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended oct. 19

winnebago industries inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half
the forest city , iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended aug. 26
a year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share
the cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , said frank rolfes , an analyst at dain bosworth inc. in minneapolis
indeed , winnebago said it started several promotional programs to spur retail sales in the fall and winter
the year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions
with the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales
but the rate of the decline snowballed in august , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the recreation vehicle industry association
at winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier
the company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for rv buyers
it 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , said robert curran , who follows the industry for merrill lynch & co
so when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases
mr. curran expects industry rv sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978
and he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year
but he said the industry has a good decade ahead , particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying rvs
winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in august , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year
the company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things
the news sent winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in new york stock exchange composite trading - a 52-week low
the dividend cut will prove most costly for john k. hanson , winnebago 's founder and chairman
based on his control of about 45 % of winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million
for the year , winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier
sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million
burmah oil plc , a british independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said shv holdings n.v. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company
the holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that burmah announced shv held as of last monday
shv , of the netherlands , which last year merged its north sea oil and gas operations with those of calor group plc and which owns 40 % of calor , was identified as a possible suitor for burmah
burmah said it had n't held any discussions with shv and that no deal of any nature is in contemplation
france 's national tobacco company , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as gauloises and gitanes , is branching out
concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores
brown tobacco in france is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called american-style cigarettes
we are n't philip morris cos. , says bertrand de galle , chairman of government-owned societe nationale d'exploitation industrielle des tabacs & allumettes s.a. , known as seita
he says that because seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the u.s. concern has done
-lrb- last year , for example , seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million french francs -lrb- $ 73.5 million -rrb- on sales of ffr 27.68 billion - a 1.7 % profit margin -rrb-
instead , he said in an interview , he is looking for ways to exploit france 's network of 39,000 tobacco agents , most of them cafes
while seita does n't own the french tabacs , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities
one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris
instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops
once activated , the card would sit in the car 's window , showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain
when the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later
seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by matra sa using japanese technology
seita and matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service
and seita is considering further diversification
it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french cracker subsidiary , belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group bsn sa
it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co
and it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops
it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business
brown-tobacco cigarettes such as gauloises now make up just 40 % of the french tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago
while seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand
so seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful gitanes blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco gitanes
the aim , says mr. de galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying french
when the supreme court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds
but the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights
the decision , webster vs. reproductive health services , illustrates how supreme court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices
in the missouri case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law
the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the constitution
last year , a federal appeals court in st. louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier supreme court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins
but the supreme court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services
the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws
already , local missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to reproductive health services , an abortion clinic in st. louis
the protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children
under a 1981 missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury
relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives
in another case , a protester , ann o'brien , was convicted of trespass before the supreme court 's webster ruling
last week , when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble
the effect of the supreme court webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of roe vs. wade , and i think this is one of the cracks , said mark belz , a st. louis lawyer who represented ms. o'brien and the other st. louis protesters
roe vs. wade was the supreme court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion
mario mandina , president of kansas city lawyers for life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , this will shut down abortion in missouri
there 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day
that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court expressly stopped short of overruling roe vs. wade
in two other cases , the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more unintended
in one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of columbia , mo. , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth
in missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension
a boone county judge rejected the motion , but daniel dodson , a jefferson city lawyer , says he has appealed
and in a case filed in federal court in august , a lawyer is arguing that missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery
high-definition television promises to be the tv of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market
although major u.s. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to japan , not everyone here is ready to give up
a handful of small u.s. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s
with only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the goliaths of the japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the japanese government
photonics technology inc. of northwood , ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a tv display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick
it already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television
two other firms , ovonic imaging systems inc. of troy , mich. , and magnascreen corp. of pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays
the new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set
replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or hdtv , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade
large u.s. companies are interested in other segments of the hdtv business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment
but except for zenith electronics corp. and international business machines corp. , which is collaborating with toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels
general electric co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to thompson-csf of france
we found the market not developing as we thought it would , a ge spokesman says
the small u.s. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized
no one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels at commercial costs , says zvi yaniv , the president of ovonic imaging
he says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that
the bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in hdtv should be , is n't doing much for now
the only material support it is extending to the struggling u.s. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency
the darpa funds are a pittance compared with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending
the commerce department estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over $ 1 billion
unless it gets more help , the u.s. industry wo n't have a chance , says peter friedman , photonics 's executive vice president
thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from u.s. laboratories
but peter brody , magnascreen 's president , says japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier u.s. innovations in color television and video recording
in the 1970s , mr. brody helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at westinghouse electric corp. 's research labs in pittsburgh
the panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image
in 1979 , however , westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television
mr. brody left the company to find other backers
he has a claim to the right to commercialize the westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of japanese producers
most american investors have just given up , mr. brody says
they are n't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter
many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds
we do n't see a domestic source for some of our -lcb- hdtv -rcb- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , says michael kelly , director of darpa 's defense manufacturing office
so darpa is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds
hdtv already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders
the navy is ordering displays for its aegis cruisers and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks
the commerce department also is trying to encourage hdtv because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries
it is n't just yuppie television , argues jack clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation
the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market
although some hdtv advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more darpa funds
each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial
they also want u.s. trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce department 's concern over their future
they all are strongly opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers , including matsushita , hitachi , and toshiba , to exempt portable color tvs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the u.s. imposes on the larger japanese color tvs
and they want the u.s. to help them sell overseas
planar president james hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in japan and south korea , while panels from those countries enter the u.s. duty-free
this is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , he says
we just have n't learned what it takes to compete
royal business group inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging realist inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws by engaging in a scheme to prevent royal from acquiring realist
royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in realist
royal contends that realist failed to disclose material information , including realist 's negotiations to acquire ammann laser technik ag , to stockholders prior to realist 's june 6 annual meeting
royal 's suit contends that the ammann acquisition was designed to entrench management and thwart royal 's offer
royal withdrew its offer to buy realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in menomonee falls , wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in july after realist disclosed the ammann purchase
the suit seeks in excess of $ 350,000 in damages
a realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it

the marina rescue center offered a very san franciscan response to the disaster
in addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs
this has been a 15-pound earthquake for me , said resident joan o'shea , who works in an acupuncturist 's office
she and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and aroma therapy -- massages with scented oils
she finds the response of marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes incredible
people have been very respectful of each other
i do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else
out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions
it 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , said barbara may
she went first for personal mementos
in post-earthquake parlance , her building is a red
after being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded
green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes
reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness
some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows
it did n't help that on saturday , after three days of sunshine , it rained
the guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , said frank fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments
the women wanted photo albums , a certain brooch , kind of sentimental things
he showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman
it belonged to her grandfather
some residents defied orders and returned to red buildings to retrieve goods
one building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby
a policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry out one last load
enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , residents said
one man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage
when he sneaked back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out
the marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake
on lampposts along fillmore street , a major marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake
the san francisco society for the prevention of cruelty to animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals
the spca says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish
for example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the marina , did n't have heat
she can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , says daralee konowitch , animalcare services manager for the spca
a warm foster home has been found
qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate , qintex entertainment inc. , filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code
qintex entertainment also said david evans , its president and chief executive , and roger kimmel , a director , both resigned
neither could be reached for comment
earlier this month , qintex australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction
mr. evans had been the de facto head of mgm\/ua for months
qintex entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries lonesome dove , said it filed for chapter 11 protection after qintex australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of the new leave it to beaver show
qintex entertainment is 43 % owned by qintex australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements
after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , qintex entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares
the stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer
jonathan lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of qintex entertainment , said qintex entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with mca
the $ 5.9 million payment was due oct. 1 and the deadline for default was oct. 19
mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements
mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on the new leave it to beaver as well as other mca properties
qintex australia was saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation
they continued to represent that to the board , said mr. lloyd
we were reassured they would stand behind the company
mr. lloyd said both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on oct. 14
at that point , he said , qintex australia stated it would endeavor to arrange the financing
however a qintex australia spokesman said his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment
in a prepared statement from australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the mgm talks , it had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex entertainment and had resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made
the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter 11 filing
he said the company believed qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means
the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors
it 's a shocker , said joseph di lillo , chairman of drake capital securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment
qintex australia was going to pay more than $ 1 billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million
qintex said mr. evans , the former president , resigned for personal reasons and that mr. kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary
mr. kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980
the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be revived
it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested
however , we are n't currently doing anything
it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , said barry diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp
the long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of banco ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of rome businessman flavio carboni on fraud charges
rome magistrates accuse mr. carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire -lrb- $ 880,000 -rrb- from the vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of roberto calvi , the ambrosiano chairman found hanged under london 's blackfriar 's bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse
banco ambrosiano , which was italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts
most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in panama and luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the vatican bank
the vatican , which denies any wrongdoing , paid $ 250 million to the milan bank 's creditors as a goodwill gesture in 1985
italian news reports said mr. carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a vatican official , pavel hnilica
italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the istituto per le opere di religione , channeled funds to east bloc groups such as solidarity in poland
neither mr. hnilica , mr. carboni nor vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend
the office of thrift supervision banned b.j. garman , a former director of the failed vision banc savings association of kingsville , texas , from working in any financial institution insured by the government
the office , a treasury department unit that is the successor to the federal home loan bank board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public
generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past
indeed , the ots said that before the law took effect aug. 9 , it banned another key vision banc insider from insured financial institutions
that individual was n't identified
vision banc was placed in government conservatorship in march , and it operates under the control of the resolution trust corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts
the ots did n't say specifically why the action was taken against ms. garman
however , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including extraordinary loan commissions paid to a firm associated with vision banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials
ms. garman could n't be reached for comment
while welcoming nicholas mcinnes 's sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your world-wide tax revolution table -lrb- editorial page , aug. 29 -rrb- , i am surprised that he neglected other errors that , for some of us , strike close to home
as a channel islander , i was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of 86 countries with an income tax
despite a history of heated local debate on the topic , my passport clearly reads british citizen
whether mr. mcinnes 's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander 's benign neglect is a question my fellow channel islanders -lrb- and friends on the isle of man -rrb- will continue to ponder

stoneridge resources inc. said it will begin an offering of rights equivalent to 2.6 million common shares and valued at $ 22,750,000
the bloomfield hills , mich.-based real-estate holding company said it will offer the rights at $ 8.75 a share to shareholders of record on oct. 26
the offering is scheduled to expire on nov. 30
the company said it will use the proceeds of the offering for debt reduction and general corporate purposes , including acquisitions
stockholders may buy one share at the subscription price for every four shares of stock they own
stockholders who exercise all their rights may buy additional shares , the company said
the company said it has an option to increase the offering by up to 350,000 shares
dow chemical co. said its destec energy inc. unit has agreed to buy pse inc. , a houston energy company , in a deal valued at about $ 115 million
dow , of midland , mich. , said its unit will begin by thursday a tender offer of $ 12.25 a share for all pse common shares outstanding
among other conditions , the offer depends on the dow unit acquiring at least 66 2\/3 % of the pse shares outstanding , the companies said in a joint statement friday
pse has about 9.2 million shares outstanding
the company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding
dow said it already has agreements with albert j. smith jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of pse , and certain other officers of the company under which dow may buy about 40 % of the pse common shares outstanding
pse is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $ 234 million
the company is owner and operator , or an equity partner , in six cogeneration facilities -- two in texas and four in california
the company said recently it expects third-quarter earnings will be in range from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share , compared with $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , a year ago
for bankers and regulators , arizona is looking more like texas every day
on friday , los angeles-based first interstate bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ 16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its first interstate bank of arizona unit
first interstate said the unit , bludgeoned by arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter
first interstate took a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank
it charged off an estimated $ 200 million of arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate
first interstate made the move under pressure from regulators
the action capped a spurt of grim arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that arizona is challenging texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard
earlier last week , valley national corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend
pinnacle west capital corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about pinnacle 's moribund merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income
security pacific corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly because of sour arizona real-estate loans
new york-based chase manhattan corp. took an $ 85 million arizona-related charge
furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind first interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it
examiners from the office of the comptroller of the currency had been combing through first interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that first interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit
when first interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million
at that point , -lcb- first interstate -rcb- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , said one industry official close to the talks
thomas p. marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations
he said the provision was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number
the tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the state 's thrifts
at least six of arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses
for example , western savings & loan association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at june 30
it had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second quarter
yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever
it also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small
the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion
together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion
they have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up
the thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter
other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property , if they can sell it at all
all this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking
in the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come
now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space
it 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , said c.w. jackson , a prominent arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses
many arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come
ralph shattuck , publisher of foreclosure update newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in maricopa county , where phoenix is located
that 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : so far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day
it 's frightening , mr. shattuck said
moreover , mr. shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures
and the generally frail condition of arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide
it 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , said mr. jackson
we 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end ...
the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is : pay me in 60 days
first interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its texas operations
for the six months ended june 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes
the bank 's arizona unit holds about $ 6 billion of first interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets
mr. marrie said the bank expects arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40 % over the last year , to fall another 20 % before stabilizing
some in arizona think that may be optimistic
first interstate said its operations outside of arizona achieved results as expected for the quarter , but did n't specify the results
first interstate stock closed at $ 57.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange
since its unsuccessful bid for bankamerica corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in california in 1991
mr. marrie said the problems in arizona have only increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective
separately , standard & poor 's corp. lowered its ratings on valley national corp. 's senior debt to double-b from double-b-plus , affecting about $ 300 million of long-term debt
s&p also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , valley national bank of arizona
the ratings service said the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition
a spokesman for phoenix , ariz.-based valley national , said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in arizona real estate
commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said , and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days
a bill that would permit the securities and exchange commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some wall street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary
the legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee and the senate securities subcommittee
richard breeden , the new chairman of the sec , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the sec additional authority during market emergencies
however , he recently told the senate banking committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans
the bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions
since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with wall street firms issuing bridge loans
but some wall street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted
in a july 6 letter to the senate securities subcommittee , first boston corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate
first boston , whose holding company , cs first boston group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on wall street , said it is also concerned that once the sec has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities
the proposal , while well-intended , i think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the sec has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , michael raoul-duval , managing director of first boston , said in an interview
the bill would divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , mr. raoul-duval said
sources in the industry and on capitol hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the sec 's concerns may be possible
an aide to the senate securities subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : nobody is wedded to the language in the bill
edward o'brien , president of the securities industry association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the sec 's goals
mr. o'brien will elaborate on the sia 's position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this week , a spokesman said
japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $ 1.82 billion for the first 10 days of october , down from $ 3.16 billion a year earlier , the finance ministry said
the latest drop shows the narrowing in the nation 's trade gap reflected in successive full monthly reports is continuing
the report follows five-consecutive declines in full monthly figures
imports rose sharply in the period , to $ 5.19 billion from $ 4.04 billion a year earlier , a change of 28 %
exports during the period were $ 7.01 billion , 2.6 % below $ 7.20 billion a year ago
guardian royal exchange assurance plc , a major british composite insurer , said it is taking a stake in nationwide anglia building society 's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the u.k. and europe
officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that gre will hold in nationwide anglia estate agents
but the companies said that nationwide anglia estate agents will market gre life insurance , pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the u.k
besides the marketing agreement , gre said nationwide anglia has agreed to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer
grand metropolitan plc , the united kingdom food and beverage group that owns pillsbury inc. of the u.s. , announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company 's recent expansion
david nash , formerly group finance director at cadbury schweppes plc , will become grand met 's first group finance director in january
in a statement , grand met said its recent growth and wider geographic spread made it necessary to create the new position
the company also reassigned several executive responsibilities
david tagg , formerly in charge of gambling operations , was appointed chief executive for retailing and property
peter cawdron , group strategy development director , and bill shardlow , group personnel director , will become part of the board 's management committee

this letter was inspired by david asman 's sept. 25 editorial-page article about fidel castro , man in the middle of drug trafficking
i 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists
in any matters between us and the cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently i 've become familiar not only with cuban art and artists , but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government
despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort
there is a simple reason for this : the cuban people
let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate
those people to whom i refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the ministry of culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the cuban revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc
in fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes che guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest
it is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that i am responding to mr. asman 's opinions of their country
the ochoa trial in july , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of cuba
however , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth
mr. asman should make distinctions among fidel , the army and the cuban people
they are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances
it is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -lrb- as we well know -rrb- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy
mr. asman is also annoyed that mr. castro has resisted collaboration with u.s. officials , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime , such as facilitating defections
i think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that fidel does n't invite the u.s. state department to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its own territory
we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom
without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years
from my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days
there is no rational justification for such behavior
cri inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its capital housing and mortgage partners inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending june 9 , 1990
the change in expected cash distributions from the champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs , said jay r. cohen , champs executive vice president
cri , which sponsors champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm
does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race
as they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both democrat david dinkins and republican rudolph giuliani are in trouble
mr. dinkins , the manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls
but , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become new york 's first black mayor
ordinarily , a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes
but mr. giuliani , a celebrated prosecutor , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled city
and now , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money
this is the nation 's biggest city and , traditionally , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician
democrats hoped that mr. dinkins could become a highly visible national leader
republicans figured that in mr. giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star
but it has n't worked out that way
dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , says david garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for mayor edward koch , defeated by mr. dinkins in the sept. 12 democratic primary
the alternative -- giuliani -- is ghastly
i guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for dinkins , says richard wade , a politically active professor who supported richard ravitch , an also-ran in the democratic primary
there 's nothing on the other side
we 're picking up steam , insists roger ailes , mr. giuliani 's media consultant , whose last big campaign helped put george bush in the white house
he adds : it just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet
but the steam may never reach the engine room
for , just as mr. giuliani latches on to an issue that has mr. dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep mr. ailes 's commercials on the air beyond wednesday or thursday
to help out this week , the white house is dispatching chief of staff john sununu and three cabinet members -- hud 's jack kemp , transportation 's samuel skinner and treasury 's nicholas brady , according to peter powers , the giuliani campaign manager
for republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating
historically , new york is almost always in trouble
but the trouble it faces now under democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past
this year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year
and hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrapping with another
people were n't so happy in the 1930s , says thomas lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary fiorello laguardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition mr. giuliani hopes to emulate
but , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other
the 62-year-old mr. dinkins , an ex-marine , has served as the city clerk and as manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities
-lrb- i defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of david dinkins , says mr. giuliani -rrb-
he defeated the contentious mr. koch in the democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds
his general-election campaign is almost reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words
his theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing new york together again
both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but mr. dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them
the 45-year-old mr. giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to mr. dinkins
he 's got to get dinkins 's negatives up , says lee miringoff , director of the marist college institute of public opinion
but our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff
why , even 20 % of the republican vote is going to dinkins
it 's assault-weapons politics , says john siegal , mr. dinkins 's issues director , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the giuliani effort
for the giuliani forces , it 's a conundrum
on the one hand , mr. giuliani wants to cut into mr. dinkins 's credibility
on the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new fiorello laguardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead new york out of the mess it 's in
it has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the liberal and conservative parties -lrb- he won the liberal endorsement -rrb- and that he turned to comedian jackie mason for help with jewish voters
mr. mason left the campaign after telling reporters mr. dinkins is a fancy'shvartzer with a moustache
shvartzer is a derogatory yiddish word for a black person
mr. dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble
he can match jackie mason with his own robert sonny carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974
the dinkins campaign paid mr. carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day
paper work on how it was spent is incomplete
mr. carson has been charged with being anti-semitic
asked about that the other day , he replied , anti-semitic
i 'm anti-white
more troubling for mr. dinkins is his record in personal accounting
it began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years
i was always going to do it tomorrow , he explained at the time
and now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in inner city broadcasting co. , headed by his old friend and patron , percy sutton , to his son , david dinkins jr. , for $ 58,000
he had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier
he says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's board of estimate
he says his son has n't paid for the shares
it looks like serious tax evasion , says mr. ailes , the giuliani media consultant
it follows the same pattern as his tax returns
he waits to talk about it until after he gets caught
he simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , says mr. powers , the giuliani campaign manager
it 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup value of the shares and their market value
so far though , no one -- not even former u.s. attorney giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law mr. dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded
the crime goes to character , says ron maiorana , a consultant to the giuliani campaign
it 's serious stuff
he evades and ducks
he 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter
it makes people think , maybe this guy is n't so squeaky clean after all , says mr. garth , mayor koch 's media consultant
the result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think
financial printer bowne & co. said it formed a business translation service , which will provide legal , financial and other services in most major languages , including japanese , chinese and russian
roland j. hawkins , chairman of jet vacations inc. , was elected to the board of this cruise line
the board expands to seven members
citizens & southern corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire security pacific corp. 's new york-based factoring unit
terms of the bank holding companies ' agreement were n't disclosed
factoring involves the purchase and collection of another company 's receivables
citizens , based in atlanta , said it has about $ 4.6 billion in factored sales annually ; the security pacific unit has about $ 1.8 billion annually
security pacific 's factoring business works with companies in the apparel , textile and food industries , among others
chicago businessmen bertram m. lee and peter bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the denver nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners
on saturday , the partners said the team would be purchased for $ 54 million by a new group including comsat video enterprises inc. , a unit of communications satellite corp. based here
comsat video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with messrs. lee and bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team
under terms of the sale , nuggets owner sidney shlenker could receive up to $ 11 million in additional payments from the franchise 's future earnings
messrs. lee and bynoe last july announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise
but the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing
comsat video is headed by robert wussler , who resigned his no. 2 executive post with turner broadcasting system inc. just two weeks ago to take the comsat position
comsat video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add nuggets games to their offerings , as mr. turner did successfully with his atlanta hawks and braves sports teams
messrs. lee and bynoe will manage the nuggets ' day-today affairs
the neighborhood around alexander haagen co. 's vermont-slauson shopping center in the watts section of los angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit
but turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb
only it is safer , and busier
over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981
a shopping center of similar size in an affluent los angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies
the watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200
three other haagen shopping centers in the watts area are doing almost as well
a successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability
major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices
along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents
thus there is even more to the vermont-slauson center than a good place to shop
this defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible
the center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment
an additional benefit is the creation of jobs
this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers
it continues through the life of the center ; the vermont-slauson center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job
as many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years
and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like
profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit vermont-slauson economic development corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the vermont-slauson center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects
bradford crowe , director of the mayor 's city economic development office , says : there is no question that vermont-slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood
what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that vermont-slauson yields
another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women
children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins
so what 's the catch
primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess
security costs are also quite high
one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing
suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them
security at a typical haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive
the entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates
shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance
infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit tv cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard
the security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its own crow 's nest above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center
local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center
these features are also used in matanky realty group 's grand boulevard plaza
haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center
security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 %
these security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban development action grants , economic development administration grants , community development block grants , tax-free industrial development bonds , enterprise zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing
many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back
however , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions
many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities
these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it
combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date
with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment
new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets
if the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond
government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit vermont-slauson and grand boulevard plaza and decide for themselves
the answer will be obvious
mr. titus is a researcher at the justice department 's national institute of justice
athlone industries inc. said that on dec. 21 it will redeem $ 10 million face amount of its $ 59.3 million of 15.625 % subordinated notes outstanding , due june 1 , 1991
for each $ 1,000 of notes , the maker of specialty metals , industrial fasteners and consumer products will pay $ 1,026.46 plus $ 8.68 of interest accrued from dec. 1
the company will notify holders of the notes to be redeemed
manufacturers hanover trust co. is redemption agent
britain 's serious fraud office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at ferranti international signal plc 's international signal & control unit
the investigation , which will be coordinated with one already under way in the u.s. , follows the discovery of what ferranti has called a serious fraud involving its u.s. subsidiary
international signal & control , lancaster , pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was bought by ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million -lrb- $ 670.3 million -rrb-
ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts , reducing its net asset value by more than half
ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will cooperate fully
derek alun-jones , ferranti 's chairman , has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible
the british defense electronics group has said it will sell # 100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles
ducks
if the white house spots one , it intends to fire a veto at it
ducks are this season 's word for new taxes , under omb director richard darman 's formulation that if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck
george bush is quite clear : no new ducks
but what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over washington
we see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the american economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities
federal child care -lrb- quack -rrb-
the clean air bill -lrb- quack -rrb-
the disabled-workers bill -lrb- quack , quack -rrb-
the bush white house is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the nixon white house did : it hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child care
it comes up with a toned-down version of a democratic proposal
the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the unexpected costs came from
consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care
the president came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on capitol hill
it would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the department of health and human services
they 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities
the initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning
new entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes
quack
the administration claims that its clean air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist michael evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range
the house bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways
for example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants
so instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants
the money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology
the bill also imposes the california auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in big sky , montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in los angeles
proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $ 500 per car
other analysts say that estimate is low
quack
nobody knows how many billions of dollars the americans with disabilities act will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails
it is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation
judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts
lawyers will benefit
private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill
the effect of nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions
all this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the reagan administration to lift this burden from the american people , states and local governments
running for president in 1980 and 1988 , george bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s
in fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard mr. bush tout his accomplishments as head of the task force on regulatory relief
government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of american business , the vice president declared when he was head of the task force
but with the impending passage of these new programs , mr. bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back
by 1986 , the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000
then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year
holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the bush presidency
we would have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy
it is merely the most obvious
what is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire
but while they are unloading these burdens , the united states is close to creating three more big ones
the bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks
the top state environmental official in massachusetts said clean harbors inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in braintree was inadequate
the official , john devillars , asked clean harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site
critics of the plan , including the town of braintree , say the incinerator is a health hazard
clean harbors , based in quincy , said it will proceed expeditiously to submit the data requested
alan mckim , chief executive officer of clean harbors said he was very much encouraged by the official 's praise of clean harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report
japan 's finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york stock-price free fall
makoto utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out
the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , mr. utsumi said
there are no facts -lcb- behind the assertions -rcb- that we sent any kind of signal , he declared in an interview
the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets
a number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in new york stock prices on oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the ual deal for one reason or another
mr. utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out
the ministry inquired about that deal -- which mr. utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress and it was necessary for us to grasp the situation
he said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry
mr. utsumi also said some japanese banks were willing to participate in the ual financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out
in general , mr. utsumi said , japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals
each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -lcb- ual -rcb- deal , he said
they are becoming more independent
it 's a sound phenomenon
sanwa bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ual proposal
a sanwa bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision
we made our own decision , he said
still , mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by japanese banks
all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position
bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads
the -lcb- ministry -rcb- thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified
the -lcb- ministry -rcb- wants to see the japanese banks pull in their horns on leveraged buy-outs , he added
although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason
japanese banks are under political pressure as well , the analyst said
moreover , analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats
clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs
at a news conference this week , bank of japan gov. satoshi sumita cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals
despite mr. sumita 's statements , it is the finance ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions
while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever , japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game
despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market , bank analysts say
flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas
jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network
pittston co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations
net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a share , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward
in the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward
revenue slipped 0.7 % to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million
pittston also owns brink 's inc. , the security service , and burlington air express , the air-freight concern
in addition to expected losses tied to the labor strike , the coal group has spent almost $ 20 million since the strike began for security , the company said
as a result , the group 's third-quarter loss widened to $ 9.8 million from the second quarter 's $ 3.6 million
pittston continues to hire replacement workers , the company said
burlington 's operating profit grew to $ 9.2 million from $ 3.8 million a year earlier , pittston said
while the tone of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound , seasonal factors are likely to hinder burlington air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter , pittston said
brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures
in new york stock exchange composite trading friday , pittston closed at $ 18.50 a share , down 12.5 cents
h&r block inc. had net income of $ 100.2 million , or $ 1.90 a share , in the fiscal year ended april 30
the figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying friday 's heard on the street column
engraph inc. recently reported third-quarter earnings , which were mistakenly shown in the quarterly earnings surprises table in last tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates
zacks investment research did n't adjust one analyst 's estimate for a stock split , which therefore was artificially high
engraph 's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7 % higher than the adjusted average of estimates
if growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash
some stock pickers already are targeting the otc market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks
best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the new york stock exchange , are languishing at depressed prices
growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements
against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal
the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , declares mary farrell , a painewebber analyst
among her otc picks are oshkosh b'gosh and a&w brands
like many otc growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million
some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long
these are sometimes dubbed emerging growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records
while many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum
that 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks
you can find some good , quality companies over the counter , but investors should be selective , says john palicka , chief portfolio manager at midco investors , a newark , n.j. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes
mr. palicka 's picks from the otc market include legent , mail boxes etc. , and payco american
the main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy
if the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , says l. keith mullins , a growth-stock analyst at morgan stanley
eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth
in anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now
understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently
the average issue on standard & poor 's 500-stock index gained 35 % last year , ms. farrell of painewebber says
smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 %
in addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year
also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips
as a result , morgan stanley 's index of 40 emerging growth stocks -- most of which are in the otc market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the dow jones industrial average has leaped 24 % and the s&p 500 has grown 25 %
the nasdaq composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 %
some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results
people are naturally suspicious of them , says mr. mullins of morgan stanley
among his favorites in his firm 's index are legent , silicon graphics and novell
however , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance
mark schoeppner , portfolio manager at pittsburgh-based quaker capital management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support
barney hallingby , managing director of research at hambrecht & quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions
on friday , hambrecht & quist added st. jude medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends
the opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , mr. hallingby says
st. jude 's market value on nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock
the medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988
kurt kruger , who follows the stock for hambrecht & quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15 a share this year
st. jude finished up 1\/4 to 44 1\/2 on friday

david baltimore , who has just been named president of rockefeller university , already knows what it 's like to go through life with nobel laureate appended to one 's name
he is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , under investigation for scientific fraud , also attached to his name
the nobel committee made the first addition ; john dingell 's congressional committee created the second
both of dr. baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed joshua lederberg as head of the prestigious rockefeller research institution
it came to light that a substantial number of rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to dr. baltimore 's impending appointment
they were disturbed at what they regarded as dr. baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with dr. baltimore
readers of these columns -lrb- the science police , may 15 -rrb- will recall that dr. baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched mit , tufts , duke , the national institutes of health and elsewhere
rep. dingell even managed to enlist the services of the secret service in his investigation of the baltimore paper
insofar as mr. dingell has a special interest in nih and the institutions that receive its funding , the rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by dr. baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded dr. baltimore of the mccarthy era
this well may be the first time that the venerable rockefeller university has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in american science
john dingell demagogues a david baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the u.cal-davis , meryl streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , jeremy rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and dutch-elm-disease researcher gary strobel 's own colleagues at montana state denounce him for violating epa rules
scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a david baltimore could have somehow placated a john dingell
-lrb- mr. dingell , by the way , has decreed another nih investigation of the baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations
something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here -rrb-
fortunately , there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out
david hubel , a nobel laureate at harvard , has taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has dr. michael debakey
nasa defended itself vigorously and successfully against a rifkin suit to block the galileo launch
scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power
in a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work
when a david baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support
mccormick capital inc. said the final proration factor was 0.628394 on its oversubscribed , $ 3-a-share tender offer to buy back as many as 1.1 million of its common shares

chairman jamie whitten -lrb- d. , miss -rrb- of the house appropriations committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist california 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to east coast victims of hurricane hugo
the sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to president bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters
the funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past wednesday
the measure is scheduled to be taken up by the appropriations committee today
the panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the small business administration
we will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , said rep. vic fazio -lrb- d. , calif -rrb-
dubbed the dire emergency supplemental to meet the needs of natural disasters of national significance , the measure is vintage whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments
such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , the legislation reads , and the new obligations shall not be a charge against the budget act , gramm-rudman-hollings , or other ceilings

mccaw cellular communications inc. said it obtained firm financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of lin broadcasting corp
morgan guaranty trust , toronto-dominion bank and provident national bank , an affiliate of pnc financial corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , mccaw said
further , mccaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks
morgan , toronto-dominion and provident are leading that syndicate
mccaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of lin for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in mccaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern
the offer is in limbo , however , because lin has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with bellsouth corp
in national over-the-counter trading friday , lin shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625
beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution
the official xinhua news agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes
it quoted liu changyi , deputy director of the beijing public security bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases
foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations
the communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world

a majority of japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to mexico under the brady plan because they 're uncertain the mexican economy will remain stable
instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , japanese banking officials said
the plan , proposed by u.s. secretary of state nicholas brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans
the officials said that most japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending
but an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other third world nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable
they ca n't take the hit to their earnings , he said
as a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later

convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $ 2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide
during the third quarter , it said , it won several significant contracts , including a five-year contract with the national institutes of health valued at an estimated $ 8 million
earlier this month , convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like digital equipment corp. and international business machines corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems
the new products allow customers to add convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which opens up a phenomenal market for us , said robert j. paluck , convex 's chairman , president and chief executive
convex also recently agreed to use posix , a standard for the computer language called unix
posix is one of three or four versions of unix , but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems
most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the posix standard , mr. paluck said , adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers

philip morris cos. , whose benson & hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at wells rich greene inc. since 1966
executives close to philip morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked backer spielvogel bates worldwide inc. , a unit of saatchi & saatchi co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account
several executives said another potential contender is wpp group 's ogilvy & mather agency , which works on some other philip morris products
both philip morris and backer spielvogel declined to comment
a spokeswoman for ogilvy & mather said the agency does n't comment on idle speculation
also mentioned as a contender was tbwa advertising , but the company denied it was participating
the loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to wells rich
benson & hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients
the account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to leading national advertisers
but philip morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million
industry executives said philip morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share
according to john maxwell , an analyst at wheat first securities , richmond , va. , benson & hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year
the brand is no. 7 overall in the cigarette business , mr. maxwell said
the slip has come despite high-profile ads created by wells rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch
that ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing
wells rich first popularized the benson & hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette
the brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance
philip morris , trying to revive the benson & hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986
wells rich greene , however , in an effort directed by mary wells lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business
kenneth olshan , wells rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment
while wells rich recently picked up hertz corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million cadbury-schweppes canada dry and sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million procter & gamble co sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million polo\/ralph lauren business
its victories include more than $ 30 million in sheraton corp. business and an assignment from dun & bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million
ford motor co. and saab-scania ab of sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return
with the collapse of the talks friday , european analysts expect ford to intensify its pursuit of british luxury car maker jaguar plc , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with ford 's archrival , general motors corp
saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business
saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers
among the possible suitors is italy 's fiat s.p a , analysts said last week
ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties
individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the no. 2 u.s. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology
ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets
in addition , ford and saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations
but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far
some european analysts speculated that officials of saab 's highly profitable scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy
meanwhile , ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market
saab 's problems were underscored friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor -lrb- $ 186.1 million -rrb- loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than saab-scania had forecast in its first-half report last month
overall , saab-scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1 billion swedish kronor -lrb- $ 155.1 million -rrb- from 1.96 billion kronor -lrb- $ 303.9 million -rrb- a year earlier
industry analysts in europe said the most likely suitor for saab now is fiat
saab and fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of saab 's 9000 model , fiat 's croma and lancia 's thema
last month , saab-scania chief executive georg karnsund said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance
but the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , he said
as for ford , analysts expect the end of the saab play will allow the u.s. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with gm for a stake in jaguar
the failure of the saab talks makes it even more crucial for -lcb- ford -rcb- to be victorious in the jaguar contest , said stephen reitman , european auto industry analyst at ubs-phillips & drew in london
ford faces an uphill fight for jaguar , however
jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm wrapped up by the end of the month
gm , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the british parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in detroit
a gm spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation
but ford clearly views jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s.
last week , ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its german-built scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name
so despite the gm-jaguar romance , analysts say ford by last friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week
about 5.4 million jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on london 's stock exchange friday , and jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence -lrb- $ 11 -rrb-

enfield corp. said in toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million canadian dollars -lrb- us$ 47.7 million -rrb- through a rights offering to shareholders
under the offer , shareholders can purchase one enfield share at c$ 6.27 for each five shares held
in toronto stock exchange trading friday , enfield closed at c$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents
the holding company said the rights offering should reduce its c$ 171 million debt to more manageable levels before dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital
at last report , enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding
the bakersfield supermarket went out of business last may
the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs
nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential inwood section of northern manhattan
the business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers
the owner was israel ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two
in his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , mr. ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint
the first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside
the second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged
two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- mr. ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt
that was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent
for providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service
for creating a focus for neighborhood life
israel ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year
the u.s. bureau of justice statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople
only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers
yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem
recent data from new york city provide more of the picture
while by no means the highest crime community in the country , new york is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development
a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by interface , a policy research organization
it gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses
the survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job
seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed
crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving
more than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises
in brooklyn and the bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year
industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average
crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses
two decades ago , the small business administration reported yale prof. albert reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national irs records
he found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones
the new york study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker
the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business
whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury
after repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives
one washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises
these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that national institute of justice director james k. stewart calls crime causing poverty
underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents
small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses
this may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like new york
bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime
the new york study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees
the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments
private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places
since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 %
few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants
in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection
this creates several problems
one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses
the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new york survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents
only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves
a second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses
only half the new york small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive
some cities , including new york , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses
but this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship
another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas
for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits
increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of pedestrian density
with national institute of justice support , the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols
small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect
while no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks
it might even have saved the life , and business , of israel ortiz

a former sperry corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel navy acquisition official during the early 1980s
frank lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for sperry in clearwater , fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe garland tomlin , the navy official
mr. tomlin , who left the navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges
the bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with mr. lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in alexandria , va
sperry merged with burroughs corp. to become unisys corp. in late 1986
court documents filed by prosecutors indicate mr. tomlin tried to steer to sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain navy electronics equiment
mr. tomlin , among other things , illegally provided mr. lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give sperry an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said
sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work
documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that mr. lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained approval of the scheme from more-senior sperry officials because the payment which -lcb- mr -rcb- tomlin requested was so large
charles gardner , a former unisys vice president , and james neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes
unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company

the dallas cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the atlanta falcons
up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , jerral jerry jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line
mr. jones takes heart
there in the center of the pack is quarterback troy aikman , the key to the cowboys ' comeback strategy
so key , in fact , that mr. jones signed him in april for $ 11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie
he 's a genuine wheaties-box athlete , gushes mr. jones
with three minutes left on the clock , mr. aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back
the crowd groans , mr. jones shakes his head , the cowboys lose the game
a few days after that sept. 17 game , mr. aikman broke a finger , sidelining him for weeks
ah , the glamour of professional sports
once fat and happy , the cowboys now are losing games , fans and money
last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue
it has some of the highest costs in the league
its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago
at the very least , mr. jones , who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench , can take comfort in one fact : these days , he is n't alone
nearly half the owners of the 28 national football league teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like mr. aikman
last year , the top 12 players on each nfl team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball
first-round draft picks have done even better : average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987
it 's a vicious circle , says art modell , owner of the cleveland browns
one team pays so much and the other pays more
we just do n't have that kind of income stream
all this is causing convulsions in professional football
owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process
though not intentionally , the cowboys ' mr. jones has come to represent this new breed of owner
shortly after buying 66 % of the team from h.r. bum bright for $ 145 million , and mindful of the cowboys ' ragged bottom line , the 47-year-old mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts
first , he unceremoniously sacked tom landry , the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five super bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons
in dallas , mr. landry has a standing just shy of sainthood
anti-jones sentiment flooded the local press : a crude obnoxious hick , said one writer ; a real oink , said another ; who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third
for mr. jones , it was just the beginning
he quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a cowboys-owned dance academy and , in july , announced plans to sell valley ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the nfl
mr. jones calls the ranch the pentagon of sportdom
it is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era
he likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help
i said , somebody come get me
i 'm at extension 29
with a new day dawning on the sport , mr. jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury
it 's just not cost efficient , he says
the place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain
when he sells it , he says , the cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near texas stadium
and as for tom landry , well , in mr. jones 's mind , he had played out his winning years
after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the cowboys needed a change , he says
football has long been mr. jones 's passion , both on and off the field
an arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 university of arkansas team that won a national championship
after college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego chargers
years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded arkoma production corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock
so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. landry
he tapped jimmy johnson , a teammate on the 1964 university of arkansas squad and the head coach at the university of miami , where he led the hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987
whatever mr. johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans , he is no tom landry
seven games -lrb- and , after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday , seven losses -rrb- into the season , the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old
in fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season
average attendance at their games , about 49,000 last year , continues flat
mr. jones is attacking the problem on several fronts
he continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back herschel walker to the minnesota vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks
to try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19
but the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit
it 's simple , says lamar hunt , who owns the kansas city chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17
if we did n't increase prices , we 'd be in the red
mr. jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping texas stadium -lrb- his deal with bum bright included operating rights for the stadium -rrb-
the suites are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $ 475,000 to $ 1 million , depending on their size and location
mr. jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time
the sales job seems to be paying off : when he bought the team , only six of the suites had been sold
today , 30 have
gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash
the biggest is the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games
last year , the cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17.6 million
the team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights
mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
he is also trying to get more stations in mexico , where the cowboys have a following , to pick up the games
mr. jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days
he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars
besides signing mr. aikman to a sizable contract , mr. jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback steve walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years
this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry , the owners contend
soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams , predicts john j. veatch jr. , an investment banker with salomon brothers who handled the cowboys sale
to tackle the problem , nfl owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries
details of the plan , which would go into effect in 1993 , are sketchy , but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability
bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance
the nfl players association , meanwhile , contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans , and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not players ' salaries
the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too
many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts
most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old
in chicago , for example , size is the issue
we have the worst lease in the nfl , contends michael b. mccaskey , the president of the chicago bears and a grandson of george halas , who founded the nfl 's predecessor organization
we 're in a metro area with millions of bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated
when the lease expires in 1999 , he says , it 's got to be changed
this year , the nfl also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp , down from 120 , in a move meant to trim payroll costs
and the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract , which expires after this season
the current contract pays the nfl $ 1.4 billion
owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings
an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn
the changes have n't come easy
like the game of professional football , the nfl organization itself is in turmoil
the new breed of team owner , mr. jones included , has been fighting the nfl bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock
in july , 11 nfl owners , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install jim finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete rozelle
mr. finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the old guard
earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed
the owners meet again tomorrow
for his part , jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that
he puts in busy six-day weeks -lrb- excluding game days -rrb- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a tv producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of arkansas reporters
to keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to augment his staff in dallas
when i made this investment , i made it on a lifetime basis , he explains
i 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on
while the cowboys may not be the best investment now , i do n't accept they ca n't be in the future
besides , to a large extent , mr. jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing
owning the cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n't provide
there is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as prime time live
a few weeks ago , mr. jones even entertained elizabeth taylor in his private suite at texas stadium
you 're in the catbird seat every day in this job , he says
move over , pornographic phone services : a legal service with a 900 number has been launched in california
a newport beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called telelawyer , using mci communication corp. 's toll-tele-phone service
cane & associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find
though the service is available only in california , telelawyer founder michael cane says he plans to franchise it in other states
he says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees
mr. cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep
we will only deal with clients on the phone , he says
we have no in-office business
telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit
local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law
there also are 800 hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation
when a caller reaches telelawyer by dialing 900-telelaw , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys
in an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers
there is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone
if the matter requires further legal work or litigation , mr. cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm
but he says cane & associates does n't receive referral fees
so far , says mr. cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions
the firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes
out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55
jury convicts congressman in connection with wedtech corp. scandal
a federal court jury in new york found u.s. rep. robert garcia -lrb- d. , n.y -rrb- and his wife , jane lee garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman
the jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a wedtech officer
the jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from mrs. garcia
wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned south bronx , n.y. , defense contractor
edward j.m. little , one of the assistant u.s. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the garcia trial is the last of the wedtech prosecutions
mr. little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the wedtech cases , including former u.s. rep. mario biaggi -lrb- d. , n.y -rrb-
lawyers for the garcias said they plan to appeal
mr. garcia , who represents new york 's 18th congressional district , which includes the bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign
in the next few weeks , i will be consulting with my political advisers and with the democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , said mr. garcia , 56 years old
mrs. garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of mr. garcia 's congressional staff
the garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities
u.s. judge leonard b. sand set the garcias ' sentencing for jan. 5
five shea & gould partners are leaving to form a new firm
the new firm , hutton ingram yuzek gainen carroll & bertolotti , will be based in new york
the five partners who resigned from shea & gould late last week are tom hutton , sam ingram , dean yuzek , daniel carroll and ernest bertolotti
they will be joined by larry gainen , who resigned from the firm of lepatner , gainen & block
howard rubenstein , a new york publicist who represents shea & gould , said , shea & gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of
mr. rubenstein said the five , who were n't on shea & gould 's management committee , are leaving on good terms
he said shea & gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm
hutton ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community
disciplinary proceedings against lawyers open to public in illinois
while investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney
the actual disciplinary hearings will be public
in addition , illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them
non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct
illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the american bar association
one vocal critic of the changes , chicago lawyer warren lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships
in addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation
nevertheless , mr. lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the illinois supreme court 's decision to institute the changes
there 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , he says
you do n't have a right to practice
you only have a privilege to practice
drexel burnham lambert inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to delaware , the 26th state to settle with drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges
drexel does n't have a delaware office , but the new york firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon
the firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states
drexel pleaded guilty in september to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission
home beneficial corp. , richmond , va. , said it contracted to sell its 50 % interest in a richmond-area shopping mall to a buyer that was n't identified
the life-insurance holding company said the sale would result in an after-tax gain of about $ 32 million , or $ 3.09 a share , in the first quarter of
the company also said it will adopt new accounting standards in the first quarter
the change will result in a charge of about $ 8.5 million , or 82 cents a share , because of an increase in deferred income-tax liability
in the first quarter of 1988 , the company earned $ 10 million , or 94 cents a share
troubled saatchi & saatchi co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including interpublic group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said
industry executives said interpublic approached saatchi in august about buying its campbell-mithun-esty unit , but was turned down by chairman maurice saatchi
more recently , interpublic inquired about one of saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said
interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , philip geier jr. , made the pitches in visits to mr. saatchi in london , the executives said
a saatchi spokesman declined to comment about interpublic
but the spokesman confirmed that saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its campbell-mithun and rowland units
he added , we have no intention of selling either business
interpublic declined comment
the offers come as saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history
takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , southeastern asset management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring
analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak
in the midst of the current turmoil , saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses
it named a new chief executive officer , former ims international head robert louis-dreyfus
it rebuffed an offer by carl spielvogel , head of saatchi 's backer spielvogel bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of saatchi
and last week , people close to saatchi said maurice saatchi and his brother , charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged
but saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses
while saatchi 's major agency networks -- backer spielvogel and saatchi & saatchi advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive
campbell-mithun-esty , for example , has had big problems at its new york office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including minneapolis and chicago
that would would make it appealing to a network such as interpublic that already has a healthy new york presence
-lrb- while there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with saatchi 's other agencies -rrb-
campbell-mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : it has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including general mills , jeep\/eagle and dow brands
rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest u.s. public relations firm , according to o'dwyer's directory of public relations firms
it would be attractive to an agency such as interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own
other saatchi units include ad agency mccaffrey & mccall , which has the mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and howard marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm
despite saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , u.s. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units
mr. louis-dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell a marginal agency or office
analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses
prudential 's final four
prudential insurance co. of america said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account
in addition to backer spielvogel bates , a saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include lowe marschalk , a unit of the lowe group ; grey advertising ; and wpp group 's scali , mccabe , sloves agency
all agencies are new york-based
a spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in newark , n.j. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months
jamaica fires back
the jamaica tourist board , in the wake of young & rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident
the memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges
among other things , the memo contends that young & rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would embarrass the government of jamaica or the jamaica tourist board
it also contends that young & rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with ad ventures , a jamaican firm hired by the agency
the u.s. indictment charges ad ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism
the memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement thursday that it would no longer handle the $ 5 million to $ 6 million account
the agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen

comair holdings inc. said in cincinnati that it bought airline aviation academy , a pilot training school based at sanford regional airport near orlando , fla
comair said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price
comair holdings is the parent of comair inc. , a regional air carrier
airline aviation , which has annual revenue of $ 5 million to $ 6 million , has great growth potential because of the large number of u.s. pilots nearing retirement age , comair said
the unit will be renamed comair aviation academy and will continue to be headed by scott williams , a son of its founder , comair said
the better business bureau of san diego and the state attorney general 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , better book inc
the settlement stems from charges that better book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986
without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories
the conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale
the attorney general 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry california businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by better book
the uproar led to the closing of the los angeles better business bureau in late 1987
oil spill case shows liability fund flaws
an unresolved two-year-old dispute stemming from an alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents
the class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the trans-alaska pipeline liability fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills
on july 2 , 1987 , the tanker s.s. glacier bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the cook inlet
commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million
defendants include british petroleum america ; trinidad corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund
the fund was created by the trans-alaska pipeline act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages
the fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ 86 million
the fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief
but the glacier bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined
trinidad corp. is contesting liability
it claims the coast guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages
that means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far
the oil pollution act , scheduled to come up for a vote in congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for rep. george miller -lrb- d. , calif. -rrb- , a sponsor of the bill
the spokesman says the glitch in the statute is the worst kind of catch-22
many law school grads find classes never end
recent law school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class
bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school
law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , says aaron weitz , head of a new york county lawyers ' association committee that sponsors such a course
in the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors
but these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says joel henning of hildebrandt inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes
the hildebrandt course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals
students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect
many law firms sponsor their own programs
at the baltimore firm of weinberg & green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course
partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers
now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says james j. hanks , a partner at the firm
los angeles creates a courthouse for kids
the children of los angeles will soon have their own $ 52 million courthouse
the building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , says edmund edelman , chairman of the los angeles county board of supervisors
designs call for an l-shaped structure with a playground in the center
there will be recreation and movie rooms
teens will be able to listen to music with headsets
study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available
and there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers
the building 's 25 courtrooms will be smaller , says charlene saunders , a court administrator
the bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals
cases in los angeles county involving dependent children are usually heard in the criminal courts building
we need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , says mr. edelman
about 45,000 children in los angeles county are under court supervision , mr. edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month
the courthouse , to be built in monterey park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992
law firm management can be quite rewarding
it pays to follow a management career path -- even at law firms
that 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by altman & weil inc. , an ardmore , pa. , law firm consultant
its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years
partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $ 217,000
